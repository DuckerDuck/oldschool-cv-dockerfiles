# Old Computer Vision implementation Dockerfiles

This repository contains dockerfiles for running older computer vision algorithms that are
written in matlab and cpp. Modifications are made to run these algorithms in [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

## Algorithms

- EQCUT: Visual Saliency by Extended Quantum Cuts, 2015, C.Aytekin, et al. 
- MBS: Minimum Barrier Salient Object Detection, 2015, Jianming Zhang, et al.
- DT: Dense trajectories and motion boundary descriptors for action recognition, 2013, Heng Wang, et al.
- STUW: Video saliency incorporating spatiotemporal cues and uncertainty weighting, 2014, Fang, Yuming, et al.
